# JavaUtils
Some Java utility methods implemented in C++
This allows you to write code like

<pre><code>assert(Integer.parseInt("1234") == 1234);
</code></pre>
in C++.

When I first started learning Java, I was amazed that these kinds of tools were available, and I wondered
why C++ doesn't have the same thing. I mostly just wrote this so that I can have it for myself, buy everyone
is welcome to use and modify it. That's why it's on GitHub :)
